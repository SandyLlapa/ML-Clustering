# ML-Clustering

What is the goal of this lab?

In this lab you will practice building, validating, and evaluating clustering models for a customer segmentation problem.

Context

Clustering helps find the groupings of data points when you do not have explicit labels to do classification. A cannonical example of clustering applicable to almost any business is customer segmentation. Customer segmentation is the strategic process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups with similar characteristics, such as demographics, purchasing behaviors, or preferences, to tailor marketing efforts, enhance customer service, and optimize product offerings.

What are we trying to cluster into groups and what are some potential characteristics of the groups?

We are clustering the different product categories based on the purchase history of clients. Some potential characteristics of the groups could include the most frequently purchased category for a particular client or grouping by categories that often need to be restocked.
